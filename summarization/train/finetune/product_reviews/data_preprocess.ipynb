The package does come with glue to glue them back on but in my opinion this case is only good for a couple of days (if that.) I wouldn't purchase another. Thanks you\n",

The only thing you might want to know is, I carry my phone in my jeans and it does fit very tightly because it is a big bow. You have to be careful but worth it.\n",

I also love the kickstand and the fact that it can be mounted to my mountain bike and car windshield with separately purchased accessory. This case is well worth the money and a good investment. Trident cases have saved my phones for many years time and time again. :)\n",
      "- Case was as described, nice bright color. Liked the case overall but it was slick and also just didn't seem to want to say in the clip. If you want just a protective case this may be fine, but for work needed to stay put in a belt clip not so much.\n",
      "- This is a great phone case. Would be better if it had a built in screen cover instead of the old cling ons. Also needs filters over some other areas.\n",
      "- This is a very solid case. I ordered it because I already managed to shatter a screen, and screen replacements are pricey. This case would likely protect against the pavement side impact that did me in. It is modular, so you can use the silcon part by itself, but that seemed flimsy. I can see the beauty of a built-in kickstand, it isn't something that I would use. And it made the case heavy. The whole thing was just bulky, with corners and ridges and such, and really hard to put in your pocket. The belt clip was facing in only, and made things even more huge. If I was going to be biking and stuff with my phone, then I can definitely see the beauty of all the attachments, but it was beyond what I needed.\n",
