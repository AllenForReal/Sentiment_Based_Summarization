Basically, if you use this case for a long time the button will become partially depressed and remain that way the longer you use the case.  This style of case is cheap and provides a slightly higher level of protection from the average user drops during a day but it will damage your lock key if it is located on the outer frame on the phone.  The same issue was something I noted when I bought this same style case for an EVO 4G.  My father took this off of his iPhone 4 and couldn't be happier.\n- very cool, durable case at an extremely good price. I've dropped my phone in this case from between 3-5ft. probably 5 times - embarrassing but true. The case never even got scratched, my phone was completely untouched. Amazing protection, and for this price - if the design appeals to you I would say buy it now. As always note if you're using a Hong Kong seller, you're going to be waiting at least 3 weeks. My only complaint was the product shots show the volume buttons are covered by the case. This was true in earlier models, but not anymore. So if that's a dealbreaker for you, shop on. Frankly I'm amazed at how few cases cover these buttons now - but whatever. The seller was cool, it's a great design, and the case is tough as nails. Highly recommend.\n- The quality is very good.  Appearance is classy.  BUT -- the stiff rubber covers the volume and on/off switch making it difficult to push the buttons. Since the phone goes to sleep mode a lot to save power, it means I hit on/off button A LOT.  I was determined to use it so I cut out the area around the buttons and it works just fine now.  Would have rated it a 5 if not for the dumb design that took time to work around.\n- For only a few dollars, a very simple, portable case that slips on and off my iPhone easily. When I'm in a hurry to get the phone out of my heavy-duty case with belt clip, this is a simple accessory.\n- It's a good and sturdy case BUT the part around the camera causes a haze when the flash is used.\n- Good Cover, Does what it should, happy with it.\n\nWhat are the pros, cons, and verdict for this product?"
